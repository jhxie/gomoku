Latest Version Info:

The program is further revised and should function properly with an
ASCII-based chessboard display.

###### 0.3 Debugging/Exception Handling ######

*      Program so far can be considered is in a moderate stable status
       unless you intentially break it, lots of input exception
       handling functionality added.

-      "update_chessboard" function's old collision detecting is obsolete
       due to an extremely obvious logical fallacy.
       
+      Input exceptoin handling added throughout "main", "gomoku_main",
       "update_chessboard"
       
!      There are lots of redundant exception handling code, especially
       in both "gomoku_main" and "update_chessboard".

%      Probably add an auto save game functionality if the program is
       forced to exit in the next version.

%      Redundant exception handling code in "gomoku_main" and
        "update_chessboard" MAY be addressed in the later versions.
	
###### 0.2 Add ASCII Chessboard ######

*      Program now is considered partially finished in terms of its
       most fundamental functionality. However, it lacks robustness,
       a LTS feature which will be further addressed by later releases.

+      ASCII-text based chessboard display

-      Original diagonal check within "winning_check" function is
       removed and completely re-written(original code left for
       reference) to deal with general conditions rather than 
       work as a Tic-Tac-Toe-like calculation.
       
!      Collision Detection is ONLY partially implemendted; the
       program should be able to detect them but so far cannot
       resolve them.

%      Exception handling need to be further enhanced.

###### 0.1 Initial Release ######

*      Program so far is poorly(imo) implemented and can ONLY
       Function properly under CERTAIN condions.

!      No Chessboard Displayed(Will be added in the following version)

!      Collision Detection in need

%      So far the program cannot handle any exceptions

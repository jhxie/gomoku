Illustration of the Project:

A simple gomoku simulation program purily implemented with Python.
The game is designed to be played between 2 players and so far no
man-machine functionality is planned nor implemented (yet).
2 Players are denoted by O and X, respectively.

Annotation Notice:
*	   General Demonstration
+/-	   New/Cut Features
%	   LTS(Long Term Support) that requires further maintenance
!	   Known Bug
----------------------------------------

###### 0.1 Initial Release ######

*      Program so far is poorly(imo) implemented and can ONLY
       Function properly under CERTAIN condions.

!      No Chessboard Displayed(Will be added in the following version)

!      Collision Detection in need

%      So far the program cannot handle any exceptions

###### 0.2 Add ASCII Chessboard ######

*      Program now is considered partially finished in terms of its
       most fundamental functionality. However, it lacks robustness,
       a LTS feature which will be further addressed by later releases.

+      ASCII-text based chessboard display

-      Original diagonal check within "winning_check" function is
       removed and completely re-written(original code left for
       reference) to deal with general conditions rather than 
       work as a Tic-Tac-Toe-like calculation.
       
!      Collision Detection is ONLY partially implemendted; the
       program should be able to detect them but so far cannot
       resolve them.

%      Exception handling need to be further enhanced.
